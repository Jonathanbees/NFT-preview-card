## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

Thanks for checking out this front-end coding challenge.

## Learnings during the creation of the solution

- I explore a little more about the responsive design and also the easiest way to center a div
- Another little challenge that i had was about how can i design the hover eye to be over the main image, i learn that this was with a position relative and next a position absolute css style, it was funny :D
